# HabitForge
*A Habit Tracking Application (Archived)*

---

## 📖 Overview

**HabitForge** is a habit tracking application developed as a learning-oriented full-stack project using the **MERN stack**.  
The goal of this project was to understand how real-world applications are structured, built, and evolved beyond tutorials.

This repository reflects the **current state of the project at the time it was intentionally archived**.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MongoDB (Mongoose)
- **Architecture:** RESTful APIs
- **State Management:** React Hooks

---

## ✨ Implemented Features (Current State)

- Create and manage habits with basic metadata  
- Track habits and streak-related logic  
- REST API endpoints for habit operations  
- MongoDB schema design using Mongoose  
- Initial frontend–backend integration  

> ⚠️ Some features are partially implemented and not production-ready.

## 🧠 Key Learnings

This project played an important role in strengthening my understanding of **full-stack application development**.

### Technical Learnings
- Designing and structuring MongoDB schemas
- Understanding the backend request lifecycle:
Client → Route → Controller → Database → Response

- Building and consuming REST APIs
- Managing asynchronous logic and debugging common issues
- Integrating a React frontend with an Express backend

### Engineering Learnings
- Importance of **scope control** in projects
- Impact of interruptions and context switching on development momentum
- Difference between *starting* a project and *sustaining* it
- Why clean restarts can sometimes be more effective than continuous patching

## 🗂️ Why This Project Was Archived

HabitForge was **intentionally archived**, not abandoned.

The decision was made due to:
- Repeated interruptions that broke development continuity
- Increasing cognitive overhead when revisiting the project after gaps
- A desire to apply learned concepts in a **fresh, more backend-focused project**
- Avoiding large-scale refactoring at an early learning stage

Archiving allowed me to preserve the work while moving forward with clearer direction.

## 📌 Project Status

- 🟡 **Archived**
- 🔒 No active development
- 📂 Code retained for reference and future review

This project may be revisited once architectural confidence and consistency improve.

## 📝 Note

HabitForge represents an **important learning milestone**, not a finished product.  
It reflects hands-on experimentation, mistakes, and growth — all of which are essential parts of becoming a better software engineer.
